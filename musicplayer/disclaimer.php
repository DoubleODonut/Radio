                <p>This website uses the concept of Music Therapy in order to help listerners with any anxiety/depression they might currently be suffering from. <br><br>
                Music Therapy is the use of music and musical elements such as dancing/singing/playing an instrument and listening to music. Music is used because of how it can be used as a distraction, or as a way to help people restore there mental state.<br><br>
                On this website you have two options of music that can help you with either afflicion, if you are suffering from <b>Anxiety</b> then I would suggest the anxiety playlist which features music to soothe and to aid in distracting you, helping to stop yur mind being so anxious. 
                <br><br>
                The other playlist is the <b>Depression</b> playlist which consists of light and uplifting music in order to raise spirits and arouse your brain into being more positive.<br><br>
                Some of the content used in this website is not mine, and I would like to say that I do not own anything and the sources to any wallpaper or song I use will be given on a seperate page.
